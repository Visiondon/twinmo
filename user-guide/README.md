# User Guide

## Dashboard :

Upon logging into the account, the user will be met with a dashboard that will display two cards.

-   The left will showcase any recent requests sent to the user by their friends.

-   The right will showcase any recent actions (completed requests the user sent or direct payment from friends).

The sidebar will be present throughout the entire app. It allows the user to navigate through the different areas of the application, see their current funds, log out, change their account data via settings, and even change their profile picture by clicking the displayed profile picture. (It can be minimized by clicking the hamburger)

## Friends List :

When entering the friends tab, the user will be met with a list of people you are currently friends with.

![Friends List Default](https://github.com/nguyntony/twinmo/blob/main/user-guide/friend-list.png)

Searching users in the search bar will return users that match your query. Users can be search by first and/or last name or username. Green icons indicate existing friendship with that user. Red icons will allow you to add them as a friend for future transactions.

## Transactions :

To initiate a transaction, search a friend in the dropdown. An autocomplete list will be generated as the user type.

Selecting a friend will render a form for the user to input various information.

-   Selecting 'Payment' will automatically process the transaction.
-   Selecting 'Request' will send a notification to the friend where they must accept or deny the request.

## Payments Dashboard (Outgoing) :

From the home dashboard, selecting the right hand side 'Payments' card will allow the user to see their outgoing requests. A badge next to the tab will display the amount of outgoing requests they have at the moment.

## Payments Dashboard (Completed) :

Any requests the user sent out that has been responded to will appear here. An icon next to the friend will represent either an approved or denied request.

Again, a badge will represent how many new completed requests the user has. This number, along with the received tab, will be calculated in the home screen badge.

## Payments Dashboard (Received) :

Any direct payments from friends will be displayed here.

To clear this list or the completed list, a button will be provided at the end of the tabs that will allow the user to 'mark all as seen' and clear the list. (This option is only there while they are in the received or completed tabs)

## Requests Dashboard :

From the home dashboard, selecting the left hand side 'Requests' card will display all incoming requests. Here, Alexis will see the request Steven just made to her.

From here, two options are presented:

-   accepting the request will process the transaction and send the notification to the sender.
-   denying the request will close the transaction and also send a notification to the sender.

## History :

Once a transaction has been marked as read, it will displayed here for future view. By default, the current month/year will be selected. The user is able to selected previous dates by clicking the date and selecting a new one from the dropdown provided.

Only transactions made in the selected time will be displayed.
